# Technical Context

## Technologies Used
This document outlines the technologies used in the Project Boxcar Brand Guide, development setup, technical constraints, and dependencies.

### Programming Languages
- **HTML5**: Used for the document structure and content
- **CSS3**: Used for styling and visual presentation
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Used for interactive functionality

### Frameworks & Libraries
The brand guide intentionally avoids external frameworks and libraries to ensure long-term stability and minimal maintenance. It uses:
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: For all interactive functionality
- **CSS Custom Properties**: For theming and consistent styling
- **Google Fonts API**: For loading Inter and Roboto font families

### Tools & Utilities
- **Visual Studio Code**: Recommended code editor
- **Chrome DevTools**: For testing and debugging
- **Git**: For version control

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Text editor or IDE (VS Code recommended)
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Git for version control

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd project-boxcar-brand-guide
   ```
3. Open the project in your preferred code editor
4. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the brand guide

### Configuration
No special configuration is required for development. The project uses a simple file structure:
- `index.html`: Main HTML document
- `css/`: Directory containing CSS files
- `js/`: Directory containing JavaScript files
- `assets/`: Directory containing brand assets

## Technical Constraints

### Performance Requirements
- Initial load time should be under 2 seconds on broadband connections
- Interactive elements should respond within 100ms
- Total page size should be kept under 2MB (excluding downloadable assets)
- Animations should maintain 60fps

### Security Requirements
- No sensitive information is stored or processed
- All external resources (Google Fonts) loaded via HTTPS
- No user data collection or storage

### Compatibility Requirements
- Support for modern browsers (last 2 versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Responsive design supporting screen sizes from 320px to 1920px width
- Accessible according to WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- No server-side dependencies

## Dependencies

### Third-Party Services
- **Google Fonts**: Used to load Inter and Roboto font families
  - URL: https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@300;400;500;600;700&family=Roboto:wght@300;400;500;700&display=swap

### External APIs
No external APIs are used in the project.

### Infrastructure Dependencies
The brand guide is a static website with no infrastructure dependencies. It can be hosted on any web server or static hosting service.

## Version Control
- **System**: Git
- **Repository**: Hosted on GitHub (or other Git provider)
- **Branching Strategy**:
  - `main`: Production-ready code
  - `develop`: Integration branch for new features
  - Feature branches: For new features or significant updates
  - Naming convention: `feature/feature-name` or `fix/issue-description`

## Deployment
The brand guide can be deployed as a static website to any hosting service:

### Deployment Options
- **GitHub Pages**: For public access
- **Netlify/Vercel**: For automatic deployment from Git
- **Internal web server**: For company-internal access
- **CDN**: For global distribution and caching

### Deployment Process
1. Build process: None required (static files)
2. Testing: Verify all links and interactive elements work correctly
3. Deployment: Copy files to web server or trigger CI/CD pipeline
4. Verification: Check deployed site for any issues
